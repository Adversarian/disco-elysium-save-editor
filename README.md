A fairly easy Logic check should reveal the function of this repository from its slug.

# To Do
- I don't know what to do.
- Fix README (soonâ„¢)

# Usage
Just download the executable from the latest release and run it. This ain't your first rodeo.

**Note**: *Your AV is probably going to throw a false-positive at the EXE file. I'm not sure how to fix it yet but it seems to be an inherent issue with Python compilers. Rest assured however that the EXE is virus free (to the best of my knowledge).*
